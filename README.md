my-deployment-files repo:
This is my first repository for trying to learn Git and create yaml files for a kubernetes deployment.  
This is very early days and a lot of this is experimental and testing. 
I have currently deployed a 3-node kubernetes cluster using microk8s and ceph storage on ubuntu server 24.04 on my proxmox cluster.
Working on trying to learn and implement standard practices with file sturctures and conventions.
