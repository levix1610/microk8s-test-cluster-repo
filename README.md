my-deployment-files repo:  

This is my first repository for trying to learn Git and create yaml files for a kubernetes deployment.  

This is very early days and a lot of this is experimental and testing.  

I have currently deployed a 3-node kubernetes cluster using microk8s and ceph storage on ubuntu server 24.04 on my proxmox cluster.  

Working on trying to learn and implement standard practices with file sturctures and conventions.  

Currently these deployments are being created WITH the help of AI resources; so review still needs to be done as well as taking discretionary caution.  

Plans on starting a formal Class to better understand DevOps best practices I will be starting in the coming weeks.
