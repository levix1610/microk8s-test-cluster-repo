# --- PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) ---
# This requests persistent storage from the cluster.
# The actual storage (PersistentVolume) is usually provisioned dynamically based on the StorageClass.
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  # name: A unique name for your PVC. This will be referenced by the Deployment.
  name: jellyfin-pvc
  labels:
    app: jellyfin
spec:
  # accessModes: Defines how the volume can be mounted.
  # - ReadWriteOnce (RWO): Can be mounted read-write by a single node. Common for most stateful apps.
  # - ReadOnlyMany (ROX): Can be mounted read-only by many nodes.
  # - ReadWriteMany (RWX): Can be mounted read-write by many nodes (requires capable storage like NFS).
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteMany
  # resources: Specifies the amount of storage requested.
  storageClassName: ceph-rbd #needs to be at this level.
  resources:
    requests:
      # storage: The amount of storage required (e.g., 1Gi, 10Gi, 100Mi).
      storage: 10Gi # e.g., 5Gi
  # storageClassName: (Optional but often required) The type of storage to request.
  # This MUST match a StorageClass available in your cluster (e.g., 'standard', 'gp2', 'managed-premium', 'local-storage').
  # Ask your cluster administrator if you don't know what to use.
  # storageClassName: <storage-class-name> , <cephfs-storage-class-name>  e.g., cephfs-sc
